Demos
=====

This directory contains a collection of demonstration notebooks showcasing how to use Enderscope. The demos are implemented as Jupyter notebooks, which can be run in Jupyter and include minimalist graphical interfaces built with ipywidgets.

The demos are approximately sorted numerically, with complexity increasing progressively. It is recommended to start with the first demo and proceed in order. The topics covered in the demos are as follows:

- ``01_demo_lights.ipynb``: Demonstrates how to connect and control Enderscope illumination using Python.
- ``02_demo_stage.ipynb``: Explains how to connect and operate the Enderscope stage with Python commands.
- ``03_demo_advanced_stage.ipynb``: Introduces advanced usage of the stage, including direct GCode interaction.
- ``04_demo_stage_control_panel.ipynb``: Shows how to build a stage control panel GUI using ipywidgets.
- ``05_demo_camera_preview_save_reopen.ipynb``: Demonstrates how to start or restart the Raspberry Pi camera preview window.
- ``06_demo_scan_12wells.ipynb``: Covers the scanning of a 12-well plate using the stage.
- ``07_demo_scan_patterns.ipynb``: Explains how to visualize the various scan patterns supported by the Enderscope stage.
- ``08_demo_simple_autofocus.ipynb``: Illustrates a simple autofocus procedure using the stage.
- ``09_demo_multi_autofocus.ipynb``: Provides an advanced demonstration of performing a multi-point autofocus with the stage.
- ``10_demo_multi_angle_shadows.ipynb``: Shows how to remove shadows by calculating pixel-wise maximum values across multiple images.

These demos aim to guide users through the capabilities of Enderscope, from basic setup to advanced functionalities. For the best experience, follow the suggested order and explore the features progressively.
